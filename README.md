Empowering Navigation and Communication in Rural and Congested Regions Using Deep Learning Technologies.
# Smart Traffic Sign Detection using Deep Learning 🚦

This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect traffic signs and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to provide real-time voice alerts. It's designed for use in rural and high-traffic urban areas where sign visibility is a challenge.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras (or your framework)
- OpenCV
- NLP (e.g., pyttsx3 or gTTS)
- GPS (optional integration)
